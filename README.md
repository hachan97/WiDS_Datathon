# WiDS_Datathon: Breast Cancer Analysis

This repository contains the R code used for the WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge #1, which focused on analyzing a dataset of breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2015-2018.

## Dataset Description

The dataset originated from Health Verity and included information about demographics, diagnosis, treatment options, insurance, and zip code. 

## This repository includes R and Python codes for:

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Scripts to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
Model Building: R code for implementing Random Forest and XGBoost models to analyze the breast cancer data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Code for generating visualizations (e.g., boxplots, histograms) to understand the data is in the Jupyter file (_sino-noteboook-1_)

This repository provides a starting point for exploring the WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge #1 data using R.
